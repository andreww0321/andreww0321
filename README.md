### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Andrew White and I am a specialist in website development. I graduated from Muhlenberg College in May 2025 with a Bachelor's of Science. I double majored in Computer Science and Media and Communication with a minor in Statistics. This GitHub contains my past and present projects, and these projects allow me to continue learning each and every day.
